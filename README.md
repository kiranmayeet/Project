Project Title: Enhanced Verifiable Homomorphic Secret Sharing for Cloud Computing

## Abstract
 This project implements a secure cloud system using AES Encryption and secret sharing. Files are encrypted, split, and stored across two cloud servers to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and access control.Verifiable secret sharing allows users to confirm the correctness of processed data. Admin and user interfaces enable secure uploads, downloads, monitoring, fostering a trustworthy and tamperresistantcloud environment.
